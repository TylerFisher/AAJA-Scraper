Session description
-----------

Before data is stored in an Excel spreadsheet, it resides as HTML text on a website. Learn how to write a script to scrape data from a website and into a spreadsheet without copying + pasting.

A hands-on workshop, attendees will first be introduced to basic scraper code before learning how to create a simple web scraper on scraperwiki.com from two computer science/journalism students who have used scrapers for both professional and personal projects.
